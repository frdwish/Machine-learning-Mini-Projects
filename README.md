# 🚀 Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Computer Vision Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of **mini projects** that I am building while learning and practicing:

- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  

The goal of this repository is **hands-on learning**, improving problem-solving skills, and building real, practical projects step by step.

> This repository is a **work in progress**. New projects, improvements, and experiments are added regularly.
